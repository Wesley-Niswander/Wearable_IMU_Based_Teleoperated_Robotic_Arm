# Wearable_IMU_Based_Teleoperated_Robotic_Arm
A repository for all of my code to be shared with the world.

This code is used to operate a custom made robotic arm using wearable IMUs. 
It models the motion of a user's arm from quaternion data collected from the sensors.
It then uses this information as a basis to model robot movement and transmits joint 
angles to the robot via http.
